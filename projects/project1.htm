    <h1>Examining and Critiquing a Website</h1>
    <h3><a href="https://www.jamilin.com/", target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamilin.com</a></h3>

        <li>
            The first thing I noticed is that the banner is low quality and yet it is front and center. 
            The social media icons are also poorly edited. The colors and the divs on the banner are nice; however, they are very bare bones otherwise.
            Her face is prominently featured on the site, to the point that is becomes off-putting.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            The site is organized top-down with site links organized side-to-side. Menu items on the top and the same links as the links further down. 
            Secondary site links open in a new tab and there is not way to get back to the main page via a site link.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            The site structure makes little sense. Many duplicate links exist, on the main page up to three links exist that point to the same href. Some links open in a new tab and some redirect the same tab.
            On multiple tabs, buttons exist right next to each other that scroll to the exact same position on the page. When paying, a third tab opens for PayPal and at this point three tabs are open for the same site.
        </li><br>
        <li>The main site and secondary pages load surprisingly quickly considering the state of the rest of the site.</li><br>
        <li>
            The colors between different pages on the site are inconsistent, but they are all mostly readable. Colors may not be the prettiest, but they work well enough.
            Font sizing makes sense throughout the site, with headers, sub-headers, and content being sized relatively.
        </li><br>
        <li>The site is fairly responsive and I could read and interact with the site at any size I looked at.</li><br>
        <li>Pages opening in different tabs is very bad and makes the entire site less navigable. The one thing about the site that is decent is the presentation of vital information as it is very easy to read and process</li><br>
